# CENG 477 – Introduction to Computer Graphics (METU)

This repository contains my homework submissions for CENG 477.

## Structure
- HW1-RayTracer
- HW2-Rasterizer
- HW3-PlanetRenderer

Each folder includes its own source code and build/run notes.

## Notes
These projects are based on official CENG 477 starter code written
by course instructors. Additional utility components (e.g. image
parsing and helper routines) originate from publicly available
sources and include their original citations within the source files.

Core rendering logic, mathematical components, camera systems,
shading effects, and algorithmic extensions were implemented by me
on top of the provided framework.
